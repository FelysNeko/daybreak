# RsPEGen

The target is to create a PEG parser generator. This is another Rust project and will primarily support Rust as target language, followed by Python and C. I will try to make it as general as possible.

Prerequisite of future [Felys](https://github.com/felys-lang/felys) syntax, inspired by [PEP617](https://peps.python.org/pep-0617/).
