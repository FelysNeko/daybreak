# PEGenesis

The project is still in the planning stage, but the target is to create a PEG parser generator based on grammar rules. The project will be written in Python and will primarily support Python, Rust, and C as target languages.

Prerequisite of future [Felys](https://github.com/felys-lang/felys) syntax, inspired by [PEP617](https://peps.python.org/pep-0617/).
